# Security Policy

daharness is dual-use software: an orchestration harness for offensive
security work (scanning, fuzzing, exploitation support, post-exploitation)
intended for **authorized testing only**. This policy covers three things
that are often conflated:

1. Reporting a **vulnerability in daharness itself** — a defect that harms
   the *operator* running the framework.
2. Reports about the framework's **offensive capabilities** — which are, by
   definition, the product's purpose.
3. The **responsible use policy** every user is expected to follow.

## Reporting a vulnerability in daharness

**Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.**

Use GitHub **Private vulnerability reporting** (the *Security* tab →
*Report a vulnerability*), which is enabled for this repository.

Please include:

- Affected component and the commit you pulled
- Minimal reproduction steps (tool, arguments, configuration)
- Observed vs. expected behavior, including relevant tool output or logs
- Your assessment of impact

**Response expectations:** acknowledgement within 7 days; fixes are
prioritized by severity and land on `main`.

**Supported versions:** none are versioned — this is pre-release software.
Security fixes land on `main` only. Pin the commit you deploy.

### What counts as a real vulnerability

Defects that harm the *operator*, not the target. In-scope examples:

- Command/shell injection where tool arguments reach a `subprocess` call
- Path traversal escaping the `ALLOWED_TOOL_ROOTS` confinement
- The API gateway failing to authenticate when `GATEWAY_API_KEY` is set
- Unintended secrets leakage (tokens surfacing in logs or scratch storage
  beyond documented retention)
- Approval-loop spoofing: any path where the operator approves action X but
  the executed action differs from what was shown
- The secretary model acquiring a capability it is not granted — e.g.
  toggling the scope gate, which is deliberately not exposed as a tool

## By design — reported, then closed as non-issues

The framework deliberately ships offensive capability. These are the
product working as intended:

- "It can port-scan / fuzz / brute-force / exploit systems."
- "It runs nmap / MSF / sqlmap / hydra — those tools attack things."
- "With the scope gate disarmed (the default), tools reach any target."
  The armed gate is operator-controlled by design; the disarmed lab default
  is a documented deployment decision, not a bypass.
- "The secretary model can request tool executions." That is the
  architecture: the secretary lane pauses every execution for operator
  approval, and the gateway/MCP lanes are documented as requiring the
  integrating harness to add its own approval layer.
- "It can be used to attack people." See the responsible use policy below.

## Responsible use policy

By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree that:

- **Authorization comes first.** Test only systems you are explicitly
  authorized to test — your own lab, written engagement authorization, or a
  bug bounty program's declared scope. Use the framework's scope tooling
  (`check_scope`, `check_reportable`, the operator-armed gate) to enforce
  it.
- **The law still applies to you.** Unauthorized access to computer systems
  is a crime in virtually every jurisdiction (e.g. CFAA in the US, Computer
  Misuse Act in the UK). This software grants no legal permission and
  cannot sign your authorization for you.
- **Target data stays on your hardware.** The secretary model must run on a
  locally hosted endpoint (Ollama or equivalent, loopback/LAN). Pointing the
  framework at a cloud LLM API transmits every tool result — credentials,
  session tokens, internal IPs, response bodies — to a third party,
  violating most program rules of engagement and, when personal data is
  involved, data-protection law. See the Legal Addendum in `README.md`.
- **No misuse support.** The project provides no assistance for use against
  systems you are not authorized to test, and no help evading the law.

*Vulnerability in the tool → the Security tab above. Someone misusing the
tool against you → the appropriate legal authorities; you may also report
it to the repository owner so the offending fork/account can be denounced
and removed from project spaces.*
